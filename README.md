## Working with the project
This project has been created to demonstrate an Anguar Crud Service which works on the Http request. 
I have used a Fake json server for this.

to open the above project.
download the zip file
extract it then open command promt, get into your current working drectory.
run "npm install"
once installed successfully->open anothe command promt window and write "json-server --watch db.json"
this will give you a link open that link then open productList.

till then your ng serve command would have completed execution and would give a localhost link. open that.

That's it you are good to go.

Thank me later.
