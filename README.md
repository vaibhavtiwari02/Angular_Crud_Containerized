# AngularCrud

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Working with the project
This project has been created to demonstrate an Angular Crud Service that works on the HTTP request. 
I have used a fake JSON server for this.

to open the above project.
download the zip file
extract it then open the command prompt, and get into your current working directory.
Run "npm install"
Once installed successfully->open another command prompt window and write "json-server --watch db.json"
This will give you a link Open that link then open productList.

till then your ng serve command will have completed execution and will give a localhost link. Open that.

That's it you are good to go.



"The most simplified way to run the Application is to simply download the docker-compose.yml file, and type docker-compose up in your terminal...it works like magic."

Thank me later.
